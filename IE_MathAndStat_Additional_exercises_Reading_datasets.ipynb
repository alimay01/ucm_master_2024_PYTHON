    "\n",
    "1. Official ISCIII (Epidemiologics Institute of Spanish Health Ministry) COVID data 2020-2022. These data are daily, per province, per gender, per age group, and are useful to plot the evolution of pandemic in Spain, and also to find out differences between any of the grouping variables present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Spanish population data, from Spanish Statistics Institute (INE). These data will be most useful to compute relative proportions of infections per age group, per sex, per province, so that we can make comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. UK Cars 2016. These are open data about all cars on sale in UK in 2016, including consumption, emissions, and basic features of the cars. \n",
